## Project Overview

This lab explores three popular front-end frameworks/libraries — **Bootstrap**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React.js** — to demonstrate layout design, responsive styling, and component-based development.

### ✅ Bootstrap Demo (`Bootstrap-demo/`)
- Created a webpage using Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)
- Included:
  - A responsive **navbar**
  - A **two-column layout** using Bootstrap Grid
  - A **styled button** and a **success alert**
- No custom CSS used — all styling via Bootstrap components

### ✅ Tailwind CSS Demo (`Tailwind-demo/`)
- Built a **responsive card-style layout**
- Included:
  - An **image**, **headline**, and **call-to-action button**
- Used Tailwind’s utility classes (e.g. `bg-white`, `rounded`, `text-gray-800`)
- Tailwind included via CDN (no additional setup required)

### ✅ React.js Demo (`React-demo/Lab-assignment`)
- Built using CodeSandbox: (https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/icy-glade-kqz35k)
and built locally to reinforce concepts
- Features:
  - A **component that accepts props** (`<WelcomeMessage name="..." />`)
  - A **button** that toggles the visibility of a message using React `useState()`

## Reflection

This lab helped reinforce the differences between:
- **Component-based styling** (Bootstrap) vs **utility-first styling** (Tailwind)
- **Manual DOM manipulation** vs **React’s declarative component model**

I found React especially powerful for creating interactive, state-driven interfaces, while Tailwind offered flexibility for rapid styling, and Bootstrap provided a robust set of ready-to-use components.
